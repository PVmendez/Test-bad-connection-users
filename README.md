## Test | Bad Connection Application

Welcome to the BCA project. ItÂ´s a prototype app to display posts from users in low-connectivity areas. The aim is to ensure posts remain accessible even when offline or with poor signal.

## Technologies:

- **Next.js**: Utilized for building a React-based web application with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Used to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)**: Employed for data fetching, providing a seamless experience by automatically revalidating data while displaying cached data.

## Running the Application:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command builds the application for production usage.

4. **Run Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command serves the production build of the application.
